# Rproject_Online_News_Popularity_Prediction_Regression

This project focuses on predicting the popularity of articles published by Mashable on social media platforms. The goal is to develop a regression model that accurately forecasts the number of shares an article will receive based on various characteristics and attributes associated with the articles.

# Dataset
The project utilizes the "Online News Popularity" dataset, which can be accessed from the provided data source: Online News Popularity Dataset. The dataset contains 61 columns, including features such as article URL, publication time, keyword statistics, sentiment analysis, and more.

# Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

# Exploratory Data Analysis: 
This section explores the dataset to gain insights and understand the data distribution. It includes dimensionality analysis, data description, removing irrelevant columns, visualizing data distribution, identifying missing data, and detecting outliers.

# Feature Selection: 
In this section, feature correlation is analyzed, and correlated features are identified for potential removal. The relationships between features and the target variable are visualized through scatterplots. Feature scaling techniques are also discussed.

# Data Preprocessing: 
Data cleaning tasks are performed, including modifying column names, handling missing values, checking for duplicates, and converting categorical variables into factors. The cleaned dataset is then split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

# Linear Regression Model: 
A basic multiple linear regression model is built using the cleaned dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), R-squared, and adjusted R-squared. Visualizations are provided to understand the model's predictions and residuals.

# Ridge Regression Model: 
Ridge regression, a regularized linear regression method, is introduced to handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting. The glmnet package in R is utilized for ridge regression, and cross-validation is performed to find the optimal lambda value.

# Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Download the "Online News Popularity" dataset from [link-to-dataset] and place it in the project directory.
- Open the R script main.R and adjust any necessary file paths or configurations.
- Run the script in your preferred R environment.

# Results
The project aims to develop a regression model that accurately predicts the popularity of articles published by Mashable on social media platforms. By analyzing various features and utilizing linear regression and ridge regression techniques, the project provides insights into the relationships between article characteristics and their impact on popularity. The evaluation metrics and visualizations help assess the model's performance and understand the predictions and residuals.

# Conclusion
The Online News Popularity Prediction project demonstrates the application of regression techniques to forecast the popularity of articles on social media platforms. The project provides a step-by-step guide to data exploration, feature selection, data preprocessing, and model building. By following the provided code and instructions, users can reproduce the results, gain insights into the dataset, and further improve upon the models for more accurate predictions.
